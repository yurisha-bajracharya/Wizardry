## About

**Wizardry** is designed with three unique levels that introduce a variety of mechanics:

- **Level 1**: The player (Harry) must collect snitches while avoiding falling bludgers. If a bludger hits Harry, he freezes temporarily.
- **Level 2**: In this level, the player uses the snitch count from Level 1 to remove ghosts from the maze and collects coins to increase the score. The goal is to reach Hermione at the end of the maze.
- **Level 3**: At the end of the maze, players face a riddle. Solving the riddle marks the completion of the game.

Through this project, we had the opportunity to apply our understanding of  C++ programming, and game design principles, while using Raylib, a simple yet powerful game development library.

## Gameplay

- **Level 1**:  
  The player controls Harry, who must collect snitches which appears one by one throughout the level. However, falling bludgers threaten the player. If a bludger touches Harry, he freezes temporarily and loses some progress. The level ends when Harry collects a certain number of snitches in the given time.

- **Level 2**:  
  The snitches collected in Level 1 are used as a resource to remove ghosts that sets player to initial position when collided. The player must navigate a maze while collecting coins to increase their score. The goal is to reach Hermione, who marks the end of the maze and completion of the level.

- **Level 3**:  
  At the end of the maze, a riddle is presented to the player. Solving the riddle will lead to a victory screen and the completion of the game.
